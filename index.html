          <p class="para">This year, I took Web Development 1 though TTA. I started with only a basic knowledge about HTML and CSS from when I tried to code a website a couple years ago, which ended up proving useful for this class. This course started out by giving the basics of the web, then covered HTML, and then got into the details of CSS. </p>
              <br>
          <p class="para">I really enjoyed taking this because it was informative, exploratory, and expanded my knowledge about website creating. </p>
              <br>   
          <p class="para">One of my favorite things to do in this class was to play with CSS and the design of websites. Creating is intrinsically motivating for me, which is why I really love design projects. My first website is a combination of everything I have learned throughout the semester, and you can see my code for it in Github. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/breannawilliams/breannawilliams.github.io" target="_blank">link</a>.

          <p class="p1">This is a screenshot of the top of my first website. I learned how to put images into websites and how to add a border. I learned how to make a list with a link to an external page. I learned how to position a text box absolutely, and how to add a png image into the middle of the page.</p>

          <img class="img2" src="../portfolio/images/websiteP2.png">
          
          <p class="p2">This is a screenshot of the middle of my first website. I learned how make an image a link (the tulip is a link to the "About me" page), and how to make a second kind of list. Also, I learned how to make an animated gradient, and how to use grid display to position elements.</p>

          <img class="img3" src="../portfolio/images/websiteP3.png">
          
          <p class="p3">This is a screenshot of the bottom of my first website. I learned how to make a table and how to add borders to table cells. I also learned how to make an email form with imput boxes, however, I have not gotten it to work yet. In conclusion, this class taught me a lot!</p>
